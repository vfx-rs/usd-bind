/** \class UsdStage

The outermost container for scene description, which owns and presents
composed prims as a scenegraph, following the composition recipe
recursively described in its associated "root layer".

USD derives its persistent-storage scalability by combining and reusing
simple compositions into richer aggregates using referencing and layering
with sparse overrides.  Ultimately, every composition (i.e. "scene") is
identifiable by its root layer, i.e. the <tt>.usd</tt> file, and a scene
is instantiated in an application on a UsdStage that presents a composed
view of the scene's root layer.  Each simple composition referenced into
a larger composition could be presented on its own UsdStage, at the same
(or not) time that it is participating in the larger composition on its
own UsdStage; all of the underlying layers will be shared by the two
stages, while each maintains its own scenegraph of composed prims.

A UsdStage has sole ownership over the UsdPrim 's with which it is populated,
and retains \em shared ownership (with other stages and direct clients of
SdfLayer's, via the Sdf_LayerRegistry that underlies all SdfLayer creation
methods) of layers.  It provides roughly five categories of API that
address different aspects of scene management:

- \ref Usd_lifetimeManagement "Stage lifetime management" methods for
constructing and initially populating a UsdStage from an existing layer
file, or one that will be created as a result, in memory or on the 
filesystem.
- \ref Usd_workingSetManagement "Load/unload working set management" methods
that allow you to specify which \ref Usd_Payloads "payloads" should be
included and excluded from the stage's composition.
- \ref Usd_variantManagement "Variant management" methods to manage
policy for which variant to use when composing prims that provide
a named variant set, but do not specify a selection.
- \ref Usd_primManagement "Prim access, creation, and mutation" methods
that allow you to find, create, or remove a prim identified by a path on
the stage.  This group also provides methods for efficiently traversing the
prims on the stage.
- \ref Usd_layerManagement "Layers and EditTargets" methods provide access
to the layers in the stage's <em>root LayerStack</em> (i.e. the root layer
and all of its recursive sublayers), and the ability to set a UsdEditTarget
into which all subsequent mutations to objects associated with the stage
(e.g. prims, properties, etc) will go.
- \ref Usd_stageSerialization "Serialization" methods for "flattening" a
composition (to varying degrees), and exporting a completely flattened
view of the stage to a string or file.  These methods can be very useful
for targeted asset optimization and debugging, though care should be
exercized with large scenes, as flattening defeats some of the benefits of
referenced scene description, and may produce very large results, 
especially in file formats that do not support data de-duplication, like
the usda ASCII format!

\section Usd_SessionLayer Stage Session Layers

Each UsdStage can possess an optional "session layer".  The purpose of
a session layer is to hold ephemeral edits that modify a UsdStage's contents
or behavior in a way that is useful to the client, but should not be
considered as permanent mutations to be recorded upon export.  A very 
common use of session layers is to make variant selections, to pick a
specific LOD or shading variation, for example.  The session layer is
also frequently used to perform interactive vising/invsning of geometry
and assets in the scene.   A session layer, if present, contributes to a 
UsdStage's identity, for purposes of stage-caching, etc. */
